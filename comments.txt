Program Analysation

For calculating the number of available moves, what is the time complexity
and space complexity of your program? Not including the time taken to read the 
board configuration from input





For calculating the sequence of moves to eliminate all enemy pieces,
how have you modelled the problem as a search problem?



What search algorithm does your program use?




If applicable, what is the branching factor of your search tree?



What is the maximum search depth?



Does your algorithm always return the shortest possible sequence of moves
that will eliminate all enemy pieces?
